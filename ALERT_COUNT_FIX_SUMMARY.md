# Alert Count Fix - Summary

## Problem Description

The alert system was sending multiple alerts within the same timeframe despite users selecting "1 per hour" alert count limits. For example, KMNO pair was triggering 3 alerts within 3 minutes even though '1 per hour' was selected.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **alert count tracking mechanism**:

1. **Incorrect Candle Time Calculation**: The system was using `getCurrentCandleOpenTime()` which calculated candle open times based on local system time, not the actual Binance candle boundaries.

2. **Missing Candle Data**: The `fetchCandleData()` function was not including the actual `openTime` and `closeTime` from the Binance API response.

3. **Synchronization Issues**: Alert count tracking was not properly synchronized with the actual candle boundaries from Binance.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Candle Data Fetching
**File**: `server/services/alertService.js`

- Updated `fetchCandleData()` to include `openTime` and `closeTime` from Binance API
- Now uses actual candle boundaries instead of calculated local times

```javascript
// Before
candleData[timeframe] = {
  open: data.current.open,
  high: data.current.high,
  low: data.current.low,
  close: data.current.close,
  volume: data.current.volume
};

// After
candleData[timeframe] = {
  open: data.current.open,
  high: data.current.high,
  low: data.current.low,
  close: data.current.close,
  volume: data.current.volume,
  openTime: data.current.openTime,  // CRITICAL: Include actual candle open time
  closeTime: data.current.closeTime
};
```

### 2. Updated Alert Count Logic
**File**: `server/services/alertService.js`

- Modified alert count checking to use actual Binance candle open times
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Ensured alert counters are properly saved to database

```javascript
// Get the ACTUAL candle open time from Binance API for the alert count timeframe
const alertCountCandleData = await fetchCandleData(alert.symbol, alertCountTimeframe);
if (alertCountCandleData && alertCountCandleData[alertCountTimeframe]) {
  // Use the ACTUAL candle open time from Binance, not calculated time
  const actualCandle = alertCountCandleData[alertCountTimeframe];
  candleOpenTime = new Date(actualCandle.openTime).toISOString();
  
  // Check if alert count limit is reached
  const limitReached = alert.isAlertCountLimitReached(alertCountTimeframe, candleOpenTime);
  if (limitReached) {
    console.log(`ðŸš« Alert count limit reached for ${alert.symbol} ${alertCountTimeframe}. Skipping alert.`);
    canSendAlert = false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Alert Model Methods
**File**: `server/models/alertModel.js`

- Improved `isAlertCountLimitReached()` method with better logging
- Enhanced `incrementAlertCount()` method with detailed tracking
- Added proper error handling and debugging information

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `server/services/alertService.js`
   - Fixed `fetchCandleData()` to include `openTime` and `closeTime`
   - Updated alert count checking logic to use actual candle times
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Ensured alert counters are saved to database

2. `server/models/alertModel.js`
   - Enhanced alert count tracking methods with better logging
   - Improved error handling and debugging information

### New Test File:
- `test-alert-count-fix.js` - Comprehensive test script to verify the fix

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Single Alert Per Timeframe**: Only 1 alert will be sent per pair per selected timeframe (e.g., 1 per hour)

2. **Proper Candle Boundary Detection**: System now uses actual Binance candle open times to determine when a new candle starts

3. **Accurate Count Tracking**: Alert counters reset exactly when a new candle opens, not based on local time calculations

4. **Blocked Duplicate Alerts**: Multiple triggers within the same candle will be properly blocked

## Test Case Verification

The fix addresses the specific test case mentioned:
- **Before**: KMNO pair triggered 3 alerts within 3 minutes despite '1 per hour' setting
- **After**: Only 1 alert will be sent per hour candle, subsequent triggers will be blocked until the next hour candle starts

## How to Test

1. Run the test script: `node test-alert-count-fix.js`
2. Create an alert with:
   - Change %: 1MIN 1%
   - Alert Count Trigger: 1HR
   - Max alerts per timeframe: 1
3. Verify that only 1 alert is sent per hour despite multiple price movements

## Technical Details

### Candle Time Synchronization
- Uses actual Binance API candle data (`openTime` field)
- Properly handles timezone differences
- Ensures accurate candle boundary detection

### Alert Count Persistence
- Alert counters are saved to database after each increment
- Proper handling of new candle detection
- Robust error handling for API failures

### Debugging Support
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Clear indication of why alerts are blocked
- Detailed tracking of candle boundaries and counts

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that the alert count system works exactly as expected:
- **Only 1 alert per pair per selected timeframe**
- **Multiple triggers within same candle are blocked**
- **Count resets exactly at new candle open**
- **Proper synchronization with Binance candle boundaries**

The system now provides reliable, predictable alert behavior that matches user expectations.
